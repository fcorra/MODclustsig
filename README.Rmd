# mod_clustsig
  
There must be so many errors in this approach that I don't recommend to anybody to use the package. It was a quick fix, to use clustsig to perform a SIMPROF with a given distance matrix (instead of using hclust).

For the same reason, I don't expect that anyone use this package but me. Anyways, you are free to use it if you want. I'll be available to answer any questions that you may have. But please, if you are not using the package to bypass the distance method, use the original version of the package.
  
Since this is a mod, almost all the code come from the original version developed by [Douglas Whitaker](http://www.douglaswhitaker.com).
It is available (and working great) at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clustsig/index.html) 

Thank you Douglas Whitaker! you save my day.
